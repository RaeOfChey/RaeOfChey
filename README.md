# Hi there! 👋 I'm @RaeOfChey

👀 **I'm interested in**: Exploring the intersection between design and software development. I’ve spent the last 5 years building brands through graphic design, and now I’m expanding my expertise into coding and web development.

🌱 **I’m currently learning**: Full-stack web development through the University of Minnesota’s Coding Bootcamp. I’m diving deep into JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Node.js, and more, while honing my problem-solving and coding skills.

💞️ **I’m looking to collaborate on**: Projects that merge creative design with functional, user-friendly software. I love contributing to initiatives where I can apply both my design background and my newly acquired development skills.
